# LondonHouseRentalsPriceChecker
This code is for web scraping rental properties data from rightmove.co.uk using Selenium webdriver. It sets some search parameters such as location, price range, and number of bedrooms to search for rental properties. After setting the search parameters, it scrapes the data of all the rental properties available on the pages returned by the search. The scraped data includes the name and image of the property, its location, price, and number of bedrooms and bathrooms. It also calculates the distances of the rental properties from two locations, namely Westminster and the University of London in two ways, either through the google directions api or through manually opeming google maps in selenium. Finally, it stores the scraped data in a CSV file named 'rentals.csv'.
